 The Collatz Conjecture â€“ ask the user for a number greater than 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach 1 by the following rules: if the number is even, divide it by 2. If it is odd, multiply it by 3, then add 1. Print the number of steps.

20 IF N <= 1 THEN PRINT "Number must be greater than 1.": GOTO 10

###Class average create DATA for a small class of 5 students the first element is the students name, the rest of the DATA is a list of grades. For each student, print their average.

IF student = 0 THEN Data "Shaggy", 80, 90, 85,100
IF student = 1 THEN Data DATA "Fred", 75, 95, 88,30

IF student = 3 THEN data DATA "timmy", 85, 84, 86,44
IF student = 4 THEN DATADATA "Bob", 78, 82, 79, 53

avg:
 avg = (grade0, grade1, grade2, grade3) / 4
